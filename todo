seriously tho: prettify output on unit tests

improve targeted verbosity settings
implicit chaining?

init function
    -- wrap file-level scope operations in jodash index
    -- string metatable options

calculate velocity and ship date

remember previous run outputs and selectively toggle verbose output for failed tests
instrumentation for debugging
    -- wrap every method in a functor that supports verbosity

better object level management of unit test harness state

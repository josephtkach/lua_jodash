seriously tho: prettify output on unit tests
automatically read unit tests from test library?

improve targeted verbosity settings
implicit chaining?

init function
    -- wrap file-level scope operations in jodash index
    -- string metatable options

calculate velocity and ship date
instrumentation for debugging
    -- wrap every method in a functor that supports verbosity

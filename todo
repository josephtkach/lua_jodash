lastFailure flag

seriously tho: prettify output on unit tests
convention: predicates should be arged like function(x,k)

hierarchy for test folders/objects

implicit chaining?

init function
    -- wrap file-level scope operations in jodash index
    -- OPTION: treat empty table as falsey
    -- OPTION: provide array pre-allocator
    -- OPTION: provide C++-bound NaaN check
    -- OPTION: enhance string metatable

calculate velocity and ship date

remember previous run outputs and selectively toggle verbose output for failed tests
instrumentation for debugging
    -- wrap every method in a functor that supports verbosity

better object level management of unit test harness state
better error when user accesses a nil function on root object

performance:
    -- don't allocate predicates on the fly if possible
    -- configuration options for memory vs. cpu tradeoffs
    -- don't (ever?) use # operator
